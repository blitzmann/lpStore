            <h3>lpStore</h3>
            <p><span class='project'>lpStore</span> is a web application useful in calculating the value of LP Store offers. It is written by <strong>Sable Blitzmann</strong> in PHP with a MySQL backend and using EMDR as a price data feed. The code is open-source at <a href='https://github.com/blitzmann/lpStore' target='_blank'>GitHub</a></p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>I was first introduced to Factional Warfare when my corp joined it after a particularly horrible null sec campaign. I immediately saw the value in automatically calculating ISK/LP and went to work on <span class='project'>lpStore</span>'s prototype. It was a simple application, with a script set to periodically run to update prices from EVE Central. I used Ellatha's site and manually copy and pasted the LP store offers for my faction - I didn't bother with other stores. Development eventually halted as my corp disbanded and absorbed into our old alliance's main corp and we moved back to null and away from FW.</p>
            <p>The null sec thing eventually faded away again, and many of us jumped right back into FW. I was interested in continuing where I left off; however I wanted to go bigger and on a much larger scale. I no longer wanted to provide data for my FW faction and for my friends only, but for all LP Store's in-game and the rest of the EVE community.</p>
            <h4>Release</h4>
            <p><span class='project'>lpStore</span> was introduced to the communitiy on April 29<sup>th</sup>, 2013, and it's source code can be viewed on <a href='https://github.com/blitzmann/lpStore' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.</p>
            <h3>lpDatabase</h3> 
            <p><span class='project'>lpDatabase</span> is a completely separate project that <span class='project'>lpStore</span> is built upon. <span class='project'>lpDatabase</span> is simply the SQL database used for <span class='project'>lpStore</span>, and it is currently being maintained separately due to the scope of the project.</p>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, CCP does not release LP Store data along with their static database dumps (I've yet to see a reason why). And so work set out collecting the data that I needed to upstart this project. I tried to search for this data online; unfortunately, it would seem that all the LP Store Database sites are outdated and proprietary (do not offer their SQL data to third parties). I finally came across usable data; thanks to Zanto Snix and his <a href='http://eve-search.com/thread/146059-1#12'>Google Doc</a>, I was able to download a CSV file of the database. His work looked like a scrape from Ellatha's LP Store site, with more than enough errors, but it seemed to be more or less complete and it was definitely a start. From there, I went through a long and boring process of detecting and correcting most of the errors and typos (more details on how I achieved this can be found <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/17mgu4/isklp_calculator_for_the_various_lp_stores/c875wqv'>in this reddit comment</a>) before finally converting it to useable SQL data.</p>
            <h4>Release</h4>
            <p>I released the first version of the <span class='project'>lpDatabase</span> to the <a href='https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&find=unread&t=197115'>EVE Online Technology Lab forum</a>. <span class='project'>lpDatabase</span> is not considered complete until all LP Stores in EVE have had their contents verified for accuracy. As the underlying data seems to come from a site scrape of Ellatha, which itself is outdated and prone to errors, accuracy cannot be guaranteed.

            <h3>emdr-py</h3>
            <p><span class='project'>emdr-py</span> is an open-source EMDR consumer script written in Python and using a Redis key-value storage backend. Initially based off of Steve Ronuken's <a href='https://github.com/fuzzysteve/EMDR-Consumer' target='_blank'>Perl script</a> (credit should go to him for how the prices are calculated). It is a set-it-and-forget-it consumer, constantly pulling data from the EMDR services for the most up-to-date prices available.</p>
            <h4>Release</h4>
            <p><span class='project'>emdr-py</span> is released on <a href= 'https://github.com/blitzmann/emdr-py' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.</p>

                <dt>Steve Ronuken</dt>
                <dd>Introducing me to EMDR and offering a sample of his EMDR script, Steve Ronuken is also extremely helpful on the forums. Not to mention he created the first LP Store using <span class='project'>lpDatabase</span> data. Visit his website for his LP Store and other useful applications: <a href='http://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Fuzzwork Enterprises</a>.</dd>
                <dt>Zanto Snix</dt>
                <dd>Zanto compiled LP Store data into a <a href='https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=2172364#post2172364' target='_blank'>Google Docs document</a>, which gave me a great starting point for <span class='project'>lpDatabase</span>.
                <dt>Ellatha and Chruker.dk</dt>
                <dd>As outdated as they may be, <a href='http://www.ellatha.com/eve/LP_Stores.asp' target='_blank'>Ellatha's LP Store</a> and <a href='http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/' target='_blank'>chruker.dk</a> were still valuable tools that I used while putting <span class='project'>lpDatabase</span> together.
                <dt>EMDR</dt>
                <dd><a href='https://eve-market-data-relay.readthedocs.org/en/latest/' target='_blank'>EMDR</a> feeds <span class='project'>lpStore</span> pricing data realtime as it's uploaded onto the network. It's probably the most inovative EVE project I've seen.</dd>
